Copy of  `lformaggia/clang-format-hooks.git` on github, a fork of  barisione/clang-format-hooks. It contains the original codes but also `PACS_clang-format`, that you hve to copy into `.clang-format` in the main directory of the example if you want it to have clang-config to use the proper configuration file:

``` bash
cp PACS_clang_config ../.clang_config
```

Then you can use the `apply-format` script or install the git hook following the instructions on the `README.md` file.

If you wan to use instead the `git clang-format` utility using the style file you must copy and rename `PACS_clang-format` as explained above and do in your repo:

``` bash
git config clangFormat.style file
```
This way git knows that has to use clang-format with the option `style=file` with which `clang-format` uses the first `.clang-format`  located in one of the parent directories of the source file (that's why you put it in the main directory of your project.).

# Note: you mast have clang, or at least clang-format, properly installed in your system!
